# Talon documentation
This repository contains my personal Talon configuration files.

This repository was originally forked from https://github.com/knausj85/knausj_talon. Thanks to the authors of that repository for their great work. I continue to follow the changes they make there, and I bring some of them over to my configs where desired. 

See the [Talon](https://talonvoice.com/) website for information about Talon.
For up-to-date documentation on Talon's API and features, please visit https://talon.wiki/.
